# HeadCount 2.0

HeadCount 2.0 is a project designed to manipulate data and create small, reusable React components.  The data contains educational stats from districts within Colorado by year, per district.  

This application was built using the `create-react-app` boilerplate. 


## Project Goals

* Separate application logic into small, testable functions.
* Create modular, reusable React components.
* Use propTypes to validate props passed to each component.
* Write meaningful, comprehensive unit and integration tests.
